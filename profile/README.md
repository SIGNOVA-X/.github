## üåü Inspiration

It all started with someone close to our team‚Äîone of our teammate‚Äôs relatives‚Äîwho is both deaf and mute. Watching their daily struggle to communicate was heartbreaking. As we started looking for existing solutions, we realized most were paid, making them inaccessible to those who needed them the most. That‚Äôs when we knew we had to act. We envisioned a single platform that could empower deaf and mute individuals, giving them a space where they could connect, express, and navigate life more easily.

## üß† Understanding the Need

To understand the depth of the issue, we conducted research and came across alarming statistics from the WHO 2025 report:

- **70 million** people worldwide are deaf-mute

- **360 million** people worldwide are deaf, including 32 million children

WHO predicts that by 2050, 1 in 4 people will have hearing problems.

**Insights from Quora:**
We also turned to public platforms like Quora to listen, observe, and learn from real experiences shared by the deaf and mute community and their caregivers.

Beyond the numbers, we also reached out to individuals facing these challenges firsthand. Their stories and struggles shaped our vision, helping us design something truly impactful.

And that‚Äôs how SignovaX was born‚Äîa step towards an inclusive world where communication is a right, not a privilege.

## üöß Challenges We Faced

### 1. Connecting with People
Before building the app, we knew that truly understanding the problem was crucial. However, finding and connecting with NGOs proved to be a significant challenge.

### 2. Sign Language Interpretation
Since we were not familiar with sign language symbols, we had to learn alphabets and common phrases to build and test the app effectively.

### 3. Dataset Challenges
- **Different Sign Languages:** There are multiple sign languages (ASL, ISL, etc.), and selecting the right dataset was crucial.
- **Lack of Text-to-Sign Data:** Very limited avatar-based datasets made implementation challenging.

### 4. Training Time & Computation
- **Huge Dataset:** Long training times and need for high computational power.
- **Uncertainty:** Model might not perform well even after hours of training.

### 5. Emotionally Sensitive Chatbot
- AI could sound cold/generic‚Äîfine-tuning prompts took time.
- Balancing empathy and helpfulness was critical.

Despite these challenges, every obstacle helped us refine our approach, making SignovaX a more impactful and reliable solution.

## üìö What We Learned

> "The best way to learn is by doing‚Äîand sometimes, stumbling."

1. **Real-World Problem Solving Starts with Empathy**
 We learned that truly impactful solutions begin with understanding the emotions, struggles, and needs of real people. Talking to affected individuals and NGOs opened our eyes and guided our entire app design.

2. **Sign Language Is a Language of Its Own**
 While working on the translator, we realized sign language isn't just gestures‚Äîit's a full-fledged language with its own grammar and structure. Respecting that was crucial in our model development.

3. **Teamwork Is Important**
 From training heavy ML models to dealing with bugs during Firebase integration, we learned that dividing tasks, supporting each other, and staying calm helped us overcome every roadblock.

4. **Be Patient**
 Integrating AI taught us that results take time. Training, fine-tuning, and evaluating models is an iterative, patient process.

5. **Building for Impact Feels Different**
 This wasn‚Äôt just another app‚Äîit was a mission. Every small feature we built felt meaningful because we knew it had the potential to change lives.

**SignovaX taught us that innovation is not just about building something cool‚Äîit‚Äôs about building something that truly matters.**
